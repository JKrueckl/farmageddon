# 🌱 Farmageddon
A simple yet engaging farming simulation game built with Godot Engine.

# 📖 Description
In Farmageddon, you take on the role of a farmer with a single mission: grow your plants, harvest them, and earn money before it’s too late! Plant seeds, water them carefully, and harvest them in time to maximize your profits. But beware—if your plants die, you’ll lose potential income and might eventually run out of money. Manage your time and resources wisely to avoid Farmageddon!

# 🎮 Gameplay Features
Planting Seeds: Begin your farming journey by planting seeds in available plots.
Watering Plants: Keep your crops hydrated, or they’ll wither and die.
Harvesting Crops: Harvest your plants at the right time to earn money.
Resource Management: Keep an eye on your finances—running out of money ends the game!
Dynamic Challenges: Plants have different growth rates and water needs, adding to the challenge.

# 📜 How to Play
Plant a Seed: Select a plot and plant a seed using your available money.
Water Your Plant: Regularly water your crops to keep them alive.
